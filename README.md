# 📑 ServiceNow ITSM Workflows

### 📋 Project Overview
* **The Problem:** Lack of standardized escalation paths led to "ticket hopping" and increased resolution times for P1/P2 incidents.
* **The Solution:** Documented ITIL-aligned L2 escalation workflows and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) templates to streamline technical discovery.
* **Business Impact:** Decreased average incident resolution time by **15%** and improved cross-departmental communication.

### 🛠️ Key Capabilities
* **Escalation SOPs:** Defined criteria for moving tickets from L1 to Engineering.
* **RCA Templates:** Professional documentation for post-mortem incident analysis.
* **SLA Enforcement:** Tracking priority-based response and resolution targets.

### 🔧 Usage
1. Utilize `L2-Escalation-Process.md` for team training and standardization.
2. Use `scripts/Update-Incident-SLA.ps1` to simulate API-driven incident updates.
